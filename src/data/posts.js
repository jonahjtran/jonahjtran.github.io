      "How I changed my perspective on recruiting and led to success in the recruiting process.",
    content: `As I continue my current semester as a student, I want to talk about a class that steers away from some of the traditional courses I have taken so far. BADM 261, or the Technology and Management Seminar, is a course where we hear and learn from professionals across a wide range of industries. Through these weekly panels, we talk about a variety of topics, like introducing a new idea to a large company or breaking into our dream job as a current student. While each of these topics and discussions have provided me with key takeaways in the area of technology and management, a topic we discussed that I wanted to talk about today is how to stand out in the job market.\n
\n
A large worry between me and my friends in computer science is the job market, which has become increasingly competitive. This has resulted in a struggle in finding internships and jobs, even when we send hundreds of applications a week. Even at the career fair, I found out that many people were not going at all, as they were discouraged and found that nothing would come out of it. Thankfully, this is something that our T&M Seminar talked about before the career fair, which I would like to talk about and share what I learned today.\n
\n
Before the actual panel given in the seminar, I attended a coffee chat with the speakers prior. Specifically, I had the opportunity to talk to Karin Dor Markovich, the lead for Synchrony’s Emerging Technology Center. During this coffee chat, I was able to hear her insights into standing out in this competitive job market. What struck me most was that it wasn’t our grades, skills, or past internships that she valued most when hiring, but two different criteria that many people don’t think about.\n
\n
The first criteria, being the interest we have in the company, was something that I usually don’t think of when talking to recruiters and other company employees. However, this criteria is what she says makes you memorable in a sea of other highly qualified applicants. This was a surprise to me, but it got me thinking about recruiting in a different way: focusing on quality interactions and applications instead of autofilling thousands of applications. Instead of using tools to just autofill your resume, maybe I should be doing research on a company I’m interested in and talking to other company employees and recruiters about their experiences at the company.\n
\n
This is the strategy I attempted to use at my university’s career fair, and while it was a long process researching the different companies I was interested in, I found myself not only having more meaningful conversations with recruiters that led to actual interviews, but I also gained a better sense of what I was interested in and what I wanted to pursue for a career. I believe that many people forget that recruiting and interviewing is just as much an interview for the company as it is for yourself, seeing not just if you would make a good fit for the company, but also if the company is a good fit for your career goals. Doing this research allowed me to find out that Synchrony was a place that aligned with my interests in both business and software development, and through this research I was able to have meaningful conversations and land an interview with the company I will be interning for next semester.\n
\n
While Karin mentioned she looks for company research and interest, she also spoke highly about the need for an applicant to have a willingness to learn. This is a common theme I hear from many companies, but a value that is commonly overlooked when compared to someone’s technical skills or prior experience. Having just started my career and exploration into computer science, I constantly find myself in awe of the many specific fields I could go into, from frontend development, to cybersecurity, to API development and so much more. I believe that there is value in trying as many things as possible, because only then will you truly know what you are passionate about. Karin’s words of encouragement on having that willingness to try new things has motivated me to dive into as many areas as I can and explore what computer science is like in each of these fields.\n
\n
Hearing these valuable insights about standing out in the job market, and the similar insights that were spoken during the panel following the coffee chat, I have gained a new perspective on recruiting that has not just served me well today but will also serve me well later into my career. I am excited to explore what areas I will try next in terms of my career, whether that’s a different area of computer science or even a business-influenced field like product management.`,
